= Qaclana Processors - Project Honey Pot processor

This is a definitive negative processor: it matches the request's IP with query results from the Project Honey Pot
(http://www.projecthoneypot.org). We try to wait for the request for about 100ms, which is the maximum delay we accept.
If it takes longer, we keep processing in background and might or not add the IP to our own blacklist.
