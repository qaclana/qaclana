= Qaclana Processors - Blacklist processor

This is a definitive negative processor: it matches the IP of the incoming request with the blocked IP ranges. If the IP
is in the range, a `REJECT` outcome is issued and the request should be blocked. As such, the response phase should
never be reached for this processor.
