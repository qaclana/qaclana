= Qaclana Processors - Whitelist processor

This is a definitive positive processor: it matches the IP of the incoming request with the whitelisted IP ranges.
If the IP is in a range, a `ACCEPT` outcome is issued and the request should be accepted. This acts only on the request,
so, a `NEUTRAL` outcome for the response phase is always returned.
