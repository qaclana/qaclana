= Qaclana API

This is the main contract for inter-component relationship. This is not a "public" API in the sense that non-Qaclana
components can interact with, but rather a public API that components can rely upon when interacting with other
components. For instance, a module might fire a CDI event that is interesting for other components. Such CDI event would
then be part of this public API.

Components of the API should try to abstain from using Java EE, except when justifiable.
