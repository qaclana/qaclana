= Qaclana Add-ons - Blocklist updater

This add-on provides a batch job that updates the blocklist periodically. It's composed of a `@Singleton` EJB that
contains a `@Schedule` configuration, so that it runs from time to time. This EJB then starts the batch job.
Before the job starts and after it finishes, CDI events are fired, so that interested parties can react to it. As there
are no consumers of these events except for the tests, these are not part of the main public API.
