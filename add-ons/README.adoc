= Qaclana Add-ons

This module contains add-ons for services and processors. The code here extends or improves the main behavior. The idea
is that the main business logic should reside on the service/processor main module, and extra behavior is added here.
One such example is the link:blacklist-updater[blacklist-updater] module, which provides a batch job for updating the
blacklist based on external sources.
