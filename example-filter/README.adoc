= Qaclana Example Filter

This is a very simple JAX-RS application that adds the filter to its WAR file. This can be used as an example of how to
consume the filter in a Java EE application. This can also be used for developing the filter. Just deploy the exploded
WAR into a running Wildfly in debug mode and configure your IDE to auto-deploy on changes.
